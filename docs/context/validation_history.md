# Validation History

## Possession 001 — reviewed behavioral baseline

- decoded frames: 499;
- camera homographies: 499;
- possible player-frame pairs: 4,990;
- final coordinate rows: 4,948 (99.16%);
- complete ten-player frames: 473/499 (94.79%);
- trajectory corrections: 98;
- interpolated coordinates: 58 across 23 bracketed gaps;
- remaining gaps: 42 leading observations without a left anchor;
- observed outside-court positions preserved: 22;
- audited interpolated outside-court positions: 3;
- visual review completed through frame 498.

This possession defines behavioral compatibility, not the empirical generalization result.

## Possession 002 — failure-discovery and hardening case

Possession 002 exposed camera-motion, identity-contamination, team-balance, and path-generalization problems. Important reviewed findings included raw tracks that changed players, incorporated bench/referee phases, or crossed team appearance boundaries. These failures drove explicit splits, match accepts/rejects, config-driven review helpers, geometry safety, and resumable execution.

Possession 002 should not be summarized only by a final coverage number; its durable value is the failure taxonomy and the refactors it forced.

## Possession 003 — empirical generalization gate

Possession 003 completed all 21 stages against frozen source commit `8bd9486` without possession-specific source edits.

| Metric | Result | Gate |
|---|---:|---:|
| Homographies | 500/500 (100.00%) | 100% required |
| Coordinate coverage | 4,921/5,000 (98.42%) | at least 95% |
| Complete ten-player frames | 431/500 (86.20%) | at least 85% |
| Final identities | 10 (5 white, 5 dark) | expected 10 and 5/5 |
| Unresolved reviews | 0 | 0 |
| Coordinate-key violations | 0 | 0 |
| Final motion-jump candidates | 0 | reviewed zero |
| Final outside-court positions | 0 | audited |

Synchronized visual review reached the final frame, and generated data/media remained uncommitted. The empirical gate passed, unlocking ball tracking.

## Migration-time regression

On 2026-08-22, the clean local checkout at `1954053` passed all 56 discovered unit/regression/safety tests with bytecode writing disabled. This verifies the preserved checkout, not GitHub's later README-only merge.
