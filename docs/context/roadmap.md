# Roadmap

## Phase 1 — Player-coordinate foundation

Status: complete for curated possessions and empirically generalized.

- person detection, court filtering, and multi-object tracking;
- team classification;
- ReID segmentation and reviewed player identities;
- camera calibration and motion compensation;
- court-coordinate export;
- audited refinement and interpolation;
- configuration-driven resumable orchestration;
- multi-possession gate.

## Phase 2 — Ball tracking

Status: next.

- define ball annotation and evaluation protocol;
- select representative clips and failure modes;
- compare small-object basketball detectors;
- associate detections through blur, occlusion, passes, shots, and rebounds;
- preserve uncertainty and missing observations;
- map ball observations into court/time context where defensible;
- render synchronized ball/player review output;
- pass a multi-possession quality gate.

## Phase 3 — Possession and event understanding

- segment live play, dead balls, transitions, cuts, and replays;
- infer ball handler and possession changes;
- detect passes, shots, rebounds, turnovers, and fouls;
- attach events to players, time, and court position.

## Phase 4 — NBA player identity and lineup context

- map persistent visual identities to rostered players;
- add jersey-number and metadata evidence;
- track lineups and substitutions across possession boundaries.

## Phase 5 — Defensive matchup inference

- primary on-ball assignments;
- switches, help, traps, and recoveries;
- defender distance, angle, closing speed, screen navigation, and contest quality;
- uncertainty for ambiguous assignments.

## Phase 6 — Defensive scoring

- define transparent features and outcome weights;
- build a human-labeled evaluation set;
- compare heuristic and learned approaches;
- validate stability across players, teams, lineups, and contexts;
- aggregate possession scores to matchup, player, and game reports.

The original made-shot/foul/pass/miss/turnover values were brainstorming examples, not approved final weights.

## Phase 7 — Full-game NBA scale

- replace/extend the current NFHS right-half-court profile with NBA court profiles;
- support both directions and full-court transitions;
- handle overlays, bench views, camera cuts, and replays;
- batch GPU stages and checkpoint long jobs;
- reduce manual review while retaining auditable thresholds;
- validate full games.

## Phase 8 — Reporting and product layer

- possession-level JSON and review clips;
- per-player and per-matchup reports;
- interactive court/timeline visualization;
- stable CLI, API, or dashboard output.
